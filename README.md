The project focuses on predicting the number of bike rentals (cnt) based on various factors like weather, date, and user activity. It follows a structured approach involving data loading, exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

The dataset used has 730 rows and 16 columns, including features such as season, holiday, workingday, weathersit, temp, humidity, windspeed, and cnt (the target variable). Preliminary checks confirm no missing values. Initial data exploration reveals that the feature registered shows the strongest positive correlation with cnt (0.945), followed by casual (0.672), while weathersit and windspeed show weaker or negative correlations. Visualization techniques like pair plots, bar charts, and heatmaps are utilized to understand relationships among variables and identify key predictors.

In the preprocessing step, categorical columns were removed for correlation analysis, and the dataset was split into training (70%) and testing (30%) subsets. A Random Forest Regressor was implemented as the predictive model. The model achieved an R-squared score of 98% for both training and testing datasets, indicating excellent predictive accuracy and minimal overfitting. The residuals (differences between predicted and actual values) were analyzed and visualized to ensure model reliability.

This project demonstrates a robust workflow for machine learning applications, including effective feature selection, model training, and validation. If you'd like, I can dive deeper into specific parts, such as improving the model, enhancing visualizations, or refining the data preprocessing.
